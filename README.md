# vue-notification-list

Create a page with bootstrap which shows all user's notifications.
- The notifications are loaded from ajax. Pull them from APILinks to an external site..
- Only the unseen notifications should be clearly visible while others should be greyed out. (unseen parameter available via API)
- Also you need to ensure that notifications are always ordered by timestamp, by creating a sort mechanism.
